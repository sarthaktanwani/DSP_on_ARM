# Digital Signal Processing on ARM Cortex M MCU #
=====================================================

This repository contains the project files I created while following the course https://www.udemy.com/share/1021sqBUATdV5TTX4=/. Here is my certificate.https://www.udemy.com/certificate/UC-d47b401e-46f3-4a8d-82c5-deb6ad201e45/. 
I used a NUCLEO 64 F401 board for all the projects. It has an ARM Cortex-M4 core with a Floating Point Unit (FPU). Other details regarding the board can be found here.https://www.st.com/en/microcontrollers-microprocessors/stm32f401re.html.

Software used:
1. Keil IDE
2. Notepad++
3. MATLAB

Hardware used:
1. ST-LINK V2 for flashing and debugging
2. STM32F401RE NUCLEO-64 board
